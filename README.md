This is a draft release of gl3.h, a header for use with OpenGL 3.1, and
3.2 and later core profile implementations. The current version is
available at [http://www.opengl.org/registry/](http://www.opengl.org/registry/). Please don't package
gl3.h for release with other software until it's out of draft status.
The structure of the file may change significantly, and the details
will probably change slightly as we make sure exactly the right set
of interfaces is included.
